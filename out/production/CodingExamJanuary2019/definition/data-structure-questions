Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
    A.  Allows different way to contain, organize and manipulate data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
    A.  empty(), size(), add(), remove()

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    A.  Database Management System
        Statistical analysis
        Graphics

what is an Array?
    A.  A collection of contiguous memory.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    A.  Array's size are fixed whereas you can expand ArrayList.

what is LinkedList?
    A.  A list of nodes where each node points to the next node in the list.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
    A.  Arrays are randomly accessible whereas you would have to traverse through a Linkedlist.

what is queue?
    A.  Data structure that is FIFO.

what is stack?
    A.  Data structure that is LIFO.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
    A.  FIFO - First in first out.
        LIFO - Last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
    A.  Mathematical expression representing the time and/or space complexity of an algorithm.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
    A.  O(1).

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
    A.  O(n)

what is tree in data structure?
    A.  A data structure that has a where each node may have left and right node.

what is graph in data structure?
    A.  A set of items connected by edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
    A.  HasTable does not allow null keys whereas HashMap does.
        HashTable is synchronized whereas HashMap is not.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas:
    RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    A.  ??????

How HashMap works in java?
    A.  Each element is a pair and the pair holds a key and its value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
    A.  Occurs during runtime when an attempt to access an index in array that doesn't exist.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
    A.  Shallow copy, deep copy, or clone().

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
    A.  Arrays are randomly accessible whereas you would have to traverse through a Linkedlist.

What is DFS and BFS?
    A.  Depth-First-Search: searches down a tree before moving to the right.
        Breadth-First-Search: searches the nodes in the level before moving to the next level.

What is Recursion?
    A.  A method calling itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
    A.  Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues, Vectors are linear.
        Trees and graphs are not linear.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
    A.  An expression that describes time and space complexity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
    A.  Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
        Selection Sort - O(n^2)
        Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
        Bucket Sort - O(n^2)
        Quick Sort - O(n^2)
        Merge Sort - O(nlogn)
        Heap Sort - O(nlogn)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
